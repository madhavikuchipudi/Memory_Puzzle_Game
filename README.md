**Memory_Puzzle_Game**

Memory Puzzle game is a board full of overturned cards developed using PyCharm and Pygame. There is a pair for each card. The player flips over two cards. If they match, then they stay overturned. Otherwise, they flip back. The player needs to overturn all the cards in the fewest moves to win. At the beginning of the game hints are provided in the form of four possible matching cards after the player flips the first one or quickly overturn groups of cards. Fun filled music is the best part of this game                                                                                      
**Implementation:**

Python, Pygame engine are used to design this game. We will use some graphics,images and music files in the game.Memory Puzzle game will consists of a main menu, where the user can choose the levels.(level 1 – Kids level),(level 2 – Adult level) and the exit button which will quit the game. Added background music for the menu part.

**Level 1 – Kids level**

In this level we have implemented the grid by adding the same music node to matching shapes. Shapes may be of different color but with the same sound node. This level helps children to play the game with more fun and interest. 

**Level 2 – adult level**

In this level we have implemented the grid with more cards by adding the music node to card flip. This level helps adults to play the game with more interest. 

**Button_main.py**

Button_main.py is the main file of this project. All the modules of different level of users have been imported in to this module and the game loop is controlled in this file. Once the user run the Button_main.py file user gets navigated to menu screen and user has the preveliege to select the level of the game and proceed further to play. Once all the cards are over turned then again the new set begins. Fun filled music is the best part of this game.
